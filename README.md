## ✍️ Putting in Your Content

All page copy lives in a single file: **`src/data/content.json`**, currently filled with placeholder text. Replace the placeholders with your own info — components read from this file directly, so you don't need to touch any component code.

Also update:

- 📄 `index.html` — `<title>` and meta description
- 📦 `package.json` — `name` field

### 📋 Sections in `content.json`

| Key | Icon | What it controls |
| --- | :---: | --- |
| `site` | 🏷️ | brand name, footer copyright |
| `nav` | 🧭 | header nav links |
| `social` | 🔗 | LinkedIn/GitHub URLs |
| `contact` | 📬 | base64-encoded email/phone (`emailB64`, `phoneB64`) and the WhatsApp prefill message — encode your own with `echo -n "value" \| base64` |
| `hero` | 🦸 | landing section: eyebrow, name, subtitle, description, stats, tech stack chips, location |
| `about` | 💬 | "About Me" section copy (story + what I care about) |
| `questLog` / `quests` | 📜 | work experience timeline (each entry: `status` of `active` or `complete`, title, employer, duration, objectives) |
| `missions` / `missionGroups` | 🎯 | projects shipped, grouped by company (each project supports `name`, `org`, optional `href`, optional `screenshot`) |
| `skills` / `skillGroups` | 🌳 | skill tree, grouped into labeled chip lists |
| `credentials` | 🏆 | education, languages, trophies/achievements |
| `contactSection` | ✉️ | closing CTA copy |

> 💡 The `{{missionsShipped}}` token in `hero.stats` is a placeholder substituted at render time with the total project count across `missionGroups` (see `Hero.jsx`) — leave the token in place, don't hardcode a number.

### ➕ Adding a New Project or Job

- **New job** 💼 — add an entry to the top of `quests` (list is newest-first) with a unique `title`/`duration`.
- **New project** 🚀 — add an entry to the relevant company's `projects` array in `missionGroups`, or add a new company group.
- **New sprite/character image** 👾 — drop it in `public/characters/` and reference it from the relevant component/hook.

### 🔒 Gated Links

External links that should be gated behind a simple bot-check (e.g. resume/project links) use the `GatedLink` component instead of a plain `<a>`.
